This folder contains examples how to use *mati* for specific applications. There are four examples

    1.	Eg01_ADCSpectrum_1compt: This example shows how to calculate ADC spectra of restricted diffusion inside some simple geometries such as parallel planes, cylinders, spheres, and spherical shells. 
    2.	Eg02_IMPULSED: This example shows how to (1) synthesize dMRI signal data using the IMPULSED model and (2) how to fit the IMPULSED model to dMRI signals to extract microstructural parameters such as d (mean cell size), vin (apparent intracellular volume fraction), Din (intracellular diffusion coefficient), and Dex (extracellular diffusion coefficient). 
    3.	Eg03_MRICytometry: This example shows how to (1) synthesize dMRI signal data using the MRI-cytometry model and (2) how to fit the MRI-cytometry model to dMRI signals to extract microstructural parameters such as distributions of d (cell size), Din (intracellular diffusion coefficient), and Dex (extracellular diffusion coefficient); and other parameters such as vin (apparent intracellular volume fraction). 
    4.	Eg04_JOINT: This example shows how to use the JOINT model to simultaneously fit d (mean cell size), Din (intracellular diffusion coefficient), vin (apparent intracellular volume fraction) and transcytolemmal water exchange described with parameters such as tau_in (mean intracellular water lifetime) and/or Pm (membrane permeability). Sample data from computer simulations and cultured cell experiments in vitro are included in this example.
